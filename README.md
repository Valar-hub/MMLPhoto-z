# What is MMLPhoto-z?
MMLPhoto-z is a cross-modal contrastive learning approach for estimating photo-z of quasars. This method  employs adversarial training and contrastive loss functions to promote the mutual conversion between multi-band photometric data features (magnitude, color) and photometric image features, while extracting modality-invariant features.
